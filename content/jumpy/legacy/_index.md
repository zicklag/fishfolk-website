title: Legacy Documentation
---
After the Bevy rewrite, the Jumpy book was revised, but not all of the old pages have been migrated
to the new revision.

The legacy documentation can still be read [here](https://fishfolk.github.io/jumpy-legacy-docs/),
and while much of it is now out of date, some of the pages still have useful thoughts and may be
good to migrate to this book.
