Open Gamedev School, here’s what we think Good Gamedev is all about:\n\nOpenness\nWithout openness we cannot learn how to make ever-better games.\nKindness\nWithout kindness there’s no playfulness in the games we make.\nCuriosity\nWithout curiosity there is no urge to explore the unknown.\n(…)\nWe practice the craft of game development, played out through being open, kind and curious.\nWe do NOT practice fake urgency, punishment or discrimination.\n\n..As for the where, when and who of the work to be done:\nDistributed\nGeographical locality is of little importance.\nAsynchronously\nOur communications are async-by-default.\nPseudonymously\nWe don’t absolutely need to know your real name, age, gender or nationality, though many of us do exchange many such details freely, e.g. for the purpose of monetary transactions.\nLastly, what do we work for, and why:\nWe work cooperatively to enrich The Commons, in service of the global community.\nThe Commons[1][2] is what sustains us and our communities, so enriching it is to enrich our selves and those around us in an ecologically sustainable manner.\nGood Games\nIn Everlasting Games, we explain our intention as game makers, and the tenets by which we aim to honor that intent. Those same tenets also describe what we believe to be a reproducible model for making Good Games.\n\nThe intention of Spicy Lobster studio (makers of the Fish Fight franchise) is to make everlasting games, holistically designed to last for as long as the game is still being played. We do this by following similar development practices as the open software movement with its many long-lived giants, like Linux, WordPress and Blender.\nThe games we build will last forever because they are:\nOpen\nAs long as a game’s inner workings are open, it can be continued, with or without its original creators.\nModdable\nBy enabling ease of modification, a game will forever evolve and grow. Cross-platform Platforms come and go. The more platforms a game exists on, the greater its longevity.\nCommunal\nA connected and tended-to community rooted in friendship is the living essence that keeps any game going. Collective ownership facilitates discourse and feedback between equals.\nSustainable\nContinuously developing and servicing a game requires continuous income. Profits should however be in the service of mutual developer-player happiness, and not for outsize individual enrichment.\nLoving Play\nThe classics we fell in love with are held in such high regard because they were designed first and foremost in service of play, I.e. they were created out of a love for play(fullness).\n\nIndie co-op\nWhile for now we formally exist only as a single-person company run out of Oslo, Norway by Erlend Sogge Heggen, we already function like a cooperative business entity, run by ~10 primary stakeholders and dozens more stakeholders of varying levels of involvement.\nAnyone who has contributed anything of demonstrable value to a Spicy Lobster game-product is owed real stake in said product, relative to their contribution.\nSocial Contract: A promise\nAnyone who partners with us will get what they’re owed.\nOur promise is that everyone will get their fair share of the pie. We can promise that without having to go through the trouble of formal contracts in the preliminary stages, because the work we do is done in the open, thus ensuring a fair estimation of value added and compensation owed in return.\nBut nothing can be owed until a significant enough amount of money has been earned, say, $20,000. For the most economically privileged among us, we don’t really need to take part in the game profits until they exceed $50k-$200k.\n(In the past we tried to put more words to this social contract in a more formal-sounding document, but further revisions are required.)\nThe Games\nFish Fight (series)\nWe are making a growing catalogue of games, all set in the same Fish World.\nJumpy 👟\nhttps://github.com/fishfight/jumpy\nTactical 2D shooter in fishy pixels style; Our flagship game. Made with Rust-lang and a *quads-derived custom engine.\n(Formerly known as just Fish Fight, as it was the first game in what later became a series of games.)\nPunchy 👊\nhttps://github.com/fishfight/punchy \nA 2.5D side-scroller beat-’em-up, made in Bevy.\nParty 🥳\nTBA 3rd addition to our Fish Fight series, inspired by the likes of Among Us and Mario Party. Made in Bevy.\nShotcaller\nhttps://github.com/spicylobstergames/shotcaller-godot \nMinimalistic 1v1 MOBA/RTS in top-down pixel style, made in Godot.\nRPG-Sim\nhttps://github.com/spicylobstergames/rpg-sim \nHeroes of Might &amp; Magic meets Majesty, sort of. Made in Bevy.\nLate Vision\nhttps://github.com/WhalesState/late-vision/ \nAKA ‘Id-game’. A low-fi game about consciousness and life patterns, made in Godot.\nOpen collaboration\nWe openly share our products and processes alike, making our entire go-to-market playbook independently reproducible by other indies. Collaborating directly with us is optional.\nHowever closely entangled you wanna get, if you are immersed in the practice of open game development we’d love to hear from you: https://discord.gg/HgrkqqB8Ru\n","id":"/blog/spicy-lobster-open-gamedev-company/","title":"Spicy Lobster (Open Gamedev) Company"},"/bones/":{"body":"","id":"/bones/","title":"Bones"},"/bones/development/":{"body":"","id":"/bones/development/","title":"Development"},"/bones/development/api-documentation/":{"body":"","id":"/bones/development/api-documentation/","title":"API Documentation"},"/bones/ecs_tutorial/":{"body":"","id":"/bones/ecs_tutorial/","title":"ECS Tutorial"},"/bones/ecs_tutorial/the-basics/":{"body":"bones_ecs is the core of the Bones framework, and all of the other crates depend on it, but it can also be used independently of the rest of Bones.\nHere we'll give an overview of Bones ECS and how to use it.\nThroughout this tutorial we assume that you have imported the bones_ecs prelude:\nuse bones_ecs::prelude::*;\n\nOr if you're using bones_lib:\nuse bones_lib::ecs::prelude::*;\n\nYou must also add the type_ulid crate to your Cargo.toml ( this won't be necessary in the future ).\nComponents\nLet's start with making some components. We'll need a Pos component and a Vel component, to represent positions and velocities:\n/// Our position component.\n#[derive(Clone, TypeUlid, Debug)]\n#[ulid = \"01GPYNA7R38W826BG79QG0X590\"]\npub struct Pos {\n    pub x: f32,\n    pub y: f32,index\n}\n\n/// Our velocity component.\n#[derive(Clone, TypeUlid, Debug)]\n#[ulid = \"01GPYN9961WQAJ19Q6NEQ6AFPH\"]\npub struct Vel {\n    pub x: f32,\n    pub y: f32,\n}\n\nComponents are just rust structs, but notice that we are required to derive at least two traits on all our components: Clone and TypeUlid.\n\nClone is required to allow snapshotting the world state.\nTypeUlid is required to provide unique component identifiers across mods.\n\nFor every different component you create, it has to have a different ULID. You can generate a ULID by going to webassembly.sh and typing the command ulid.\n\nNote: We are considering removing the TypeUlid requirement. See this issue for details.\n\nSystems\nNow that we have components, we can create our systems.\nSetup\nLet's start off with a setup_system that will spawn some entities into our world.\nSystems in Bones ECS are just functions or closures where all the arguments are SystemParams.\n// Spawn our initial entities.\nfn setup_system(\n    mut entities: ResMut&lt;Entities&gt;,\n    mut positions: CompMut&lt;Pos&gt;,\n    mut velocities: CompMut&lt;Vel&gt;,\n) {\n    // Create our first entity\n    let ent1 = entities.create();\n    // Add add Pos and a Vel component to it.\n    positions.insert(ent1, Pos { x: 0., y: 0.});\n    velocities.insert(ent1, Vel { x: 3.0, y: 1.0 });\n\n    // And do the same with another entity\n    let ent2 = entities.create();\n    positions.insert(ent2, Pos { x: 0., y: 100. });\n    velocities.insert(ent2, Vel { x: 0.0, y: -1.0 });\n}\n\nNotice here how we use two different kinds of system parameters: ResMut and CompMut.\n\nResMut gives us mutable access to a resource. In this case, we specifically access the Entities resource, which is always present in the World. The Entities resource allows us to create and kill entities, as well as iterate over entities.\nCompMut gives us mutable access to a component store. CompMut&lt;Vel&gt; can almost be though of as a HashMap&lt;Entity, Vel&gt;. Similarly, you can get the position of an entity with positions.get(ent).\n\nFor both resources and components there are non-mutable variants, Res and Comp, that may be used of you only need to read from it.\nPosition-Velocity System\nNow that we've got our setup_system made, let's add a system that will update all the entity's positions based on their velocities.\nfn pos_vel_system(\n    entities: Res&lt;Entities&gt;,\n    mut positions: CompMut&lt;Pos&gt;,\n    velocities: Comp&lt;Vel&gt;,\n) {\n    for (entity, (pos, vel)) in entities.iter_with((&amp;mut positions, &amp;velocities)) {\n        pos.x += vel.x;\n        pos.y += vel.y;\n    }\n}\n\nHere we see a new feature of the Entities resource. It allows us to iterate over all of our entities that have specific components. In this case, want to iterate over all our entities that have a position and a velocity, with mutable access to the position and read access to the velocity.\nPrint System\nFinally, we'll want to be able to see what our system is doing, so let's add one more system to print out the velocities and positions of our entities:\nfn print_system(\n    entities: Res&lt;Entities&gt;,\n    positions: Comp&lt;Pos&gt;,\n    velocities: Comp&lt;Vel&gt;,\n) {\n    println!(\"========\");\n\n    for (entity, (pos, vel)) in entities.iter_with((&amp;positions, &amp;velocities)) {\n        println!(\"{entity:?}: {pos:?} - {vel:?}\");\n    }\n}\n\nWorld and SystemStages\nNow that we've defined our components and our systems, it's time to put them together.\nThe first step is to create a World to store our components and resources in:\n# extern crate bones_ecs;\n# use bones_ecs::prelude::*;\nlet mut world = World::new();\n\nAnd now we can run our setup system, to create our entities:\nworld.run_system(setup_system).unwrap();\n\nThe run_system() function will run a system one time. Though we haven't done so in any of our systems so far, systems are allowed to return a SystemResult, so we have to unwrap the possible error when running the system.\nWhile we only want to run our setup system once, we will need to run our other systems multiple times, and for that we use SystemStages.\nlet mut stages = SystemStages::with_core_stages();\n\nThis creates a new SystemStages collection, pre-populated with the CoreStages. There are five core stages, run in order:\n\nCoreStage::First\nCoreStage::PreUpdate\nCoreStage::Update\nCoreStage::PostUpdate\nCoreStage::Last\n\nThese groupings make it easier to control which order your systems run, when you have a lot of different modules all adding systems to your SystemStages.\nstages\n    .add_system_to_stage(CoreStage::Update, pos_vel_system)\n    .add_system_to_stage(CoreStage::PostUpdate, print_system);\n\nOnce we have added all our systems we have to initialize them. This will make sure that any component store or resources that they access are created registered with the world.\nstages.initialize_systems(&amp;mut world);\n\nFinally, we can run our stages against the world, and it will be sure to execute all of our systems in all of their stages every time we call run(). Let's run it ten times, so we can see our positions changing according to their velocity over a few frames:\nfor _ in 0..10 {\n    stages.run(&amp;mut world).unwrap();\n}\n\nFull Example\nAnd that's it for the intro!

This is important so that the entire game core can be snapshot/restored.\nThis means that to collect input, you must read those inputs from an ECS resource, and to render sprites, map tiles, etc., you must create entities with specific components that tell Bones how to render them.\nBevy Renderer\nOnce you have your game core, you can render the core in a Bevy game using the bones_bevy_renderer crate.\nThis lets you utilize the power and plugin ecosystem of Bevy to interact with rendering, input, etc. while keeping your core game deterministic, snapshot-able, and moddable.\nYou are also free to create your own rendering components that you synchronize with Bevy to support any custom rendering/audio use-cases, etc.\n\nNote: Bones ECS as well as bones_lib can technically be used without Bevy. Right now we are focusing on Bevy, and support for alternative uses may not be well polished/complete yet, but it's still within the realm of possibility to render Bones cores with any framework you want.\n\nBones App ( Future )\nAs we get a feel for how things fit together with the use of Bones in Jumpy, we hope to be able to create a standardized game runner around Bones game cores. This would allow the Bones app to handle common things like localization, asset loading, input mapping, settings menu, networking, etc., allowing you to focus on writing what makes your game unique.\n","id":"/bones/overview/introduction/","title":"Introduction"},"/code-of-conduct/":{"body":"Our Pledge\nWe as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our\ncommunity a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body\nsize, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender\nidentity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,\nnationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity\nand orientation.\nWe pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,\ndiverse, inclusive, and healthy community.\nOur Standards\nExamples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our\ncommunity include:\n\nDemonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people\nBeing respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences\nGiving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback\nAccepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,\nand learning from the experience\nFocusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the\noverall community\n\nExamples of unacceptable behavior include:\n\nThe use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or\nadvances of any kind\nTrolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks\nPublic or private harassment\nPublishing others' private information, such as a physical or email\naddress, without their explicit permission\nOther conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a\nprofessional setting\n\nEnforcement Responsibilities\nCommunity leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of\nacceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in\nresponse to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,\nor harmful.\nCommunity leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject\ncomments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are\nnot aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation\ndecisions when appropriate.\nScope\nThis Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces and also applies when\nan individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.\nExamples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address,\nposting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed\nrepresentative at an online or offline event.\nEnforcement\nInstances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be\nreported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at\ne.soghe@gmail.com.\nAll complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.\nAll community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the\nreporter of any incident.\nEnforcement Guidelines\nCommunity leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining\nthe consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:\n1.

Following these steps will help your custom art fit better in the Fish Fight world. For this example, we will focus on creating a cannon weapon, but these principles can be applied to other assets as well. If you are completely new to pixel art, make sure to take a look at the Additional Resources section first.\nConcept\nBefore you start drawing, you need to have a clear idea of what it is you are creating. We recommend finding a few reference images that you can look at while creating your art. Even the best artists do this. Drawing something completely from memory tends to not give the best results. Below are some reference images we found for cannons.\n\nOutline\nNow that you have some references, you can start drawing your art! To start off, draw an outline of the object's prominent features. Keep outlining more details until it is recognizable as the object you are creating. Below is the outline for the cannon weapon:\n\nHere are the guidelines we use for outlining:\n\nAll details for the object should be completely surrounded by outlines\nAll outlines should be 1 pixel thick\nOutlines should use a dark color\nGenerally, all outlines should be the same color\nOnly non-solid materials like smoke, fire, etc. should be drawn without outlines\nIf the object has holes, make them the same color as the outline\n\nColor\nAfter you've finished outlining your object you are ready to begin coloring. Below is the cannon weapon after being colored:\n\nHere are the guidelines we use for applying color:\n\nUse colors that have a similar saturation level with game's existing assets\nUse contrasting colors to distinguish different parts of the object\nThe entire object should be filled with color (no transparency)\n\nShadows and Details\nAfter coloring, shadows and details can be added to the object, but try to keep it clean and recognizable. Below is the cannon after adding shadows and details.\n\nHere are the guidelines we use for adding shadows and details:\n\nFor contrasting shadows, use one light and one dark color\nUse hue shifting to create color ramps\nAvoid anti-aliasing\n\nConclusion\nBelow is the full process for creating the cannon art:\n\nAdditional Resources\nIf you are new to pixel art, we recommend that you take a look at these tutorials to learn the basics first.\n\n3 PixelArt Techniques/Common Mistakes\nHue Shifting in Pixel Art\nLight &amp; Shading Basics\n\nWe hope this guide was helpful for understanding the Fish Fight art style.

You'll be\nusing it to clone, track, and manage the source code locally on your machine.\nTo get a copy of the code, you'll first need to fork the repository.\nThe GitHub repository for Fight Fight is available here.\nThis will allow you to make changes to the project without affecting the original one.\nOnce you've forked the Fish Fight repository, you can now clone it:\ngit clone https://github.com/fishfolk/jumpy.git\nIt's also possible to clone the repo using SSH or GitHub CLI. For more information on how to do\nthis, see the official GitHub documentation.\nDepending on your connection, the clone can take around 1 minute.\nBy the end of this step, you should have successfully forked and downloaded a clone of Fish Fight on your machine.\nBuild and run\nYou can now build your forked copy of Fish Fight:\ncargo build\nThis process should take about a minute or two depending on your machine. You can also build and run the game with a single command:\ncargo run\nFinding a good first issue\nNow that you can build and run Fish Fight source code, let's find something to work on!\nWe recommend all newcomers start with our Development Tracks.\nYou can also browse project's issues list and pick something with a help wanted label.\nIn general, you can comment on an issue expressing interest and someone will assign it to you.\nAdditionally, if there's a track or issue you're particularly interested in, but you don't know where to start, feel free to\nreach out to the Fish Fight Discord community with your questions\nand someone should reach out shortly!\nWrite code and submitting for review\nIn general, Fish Fight uses a branch-based workflow (or GitHub flow) for submitting changes to the project.\nCreate a new branch\nYou'll want to create a new branch off main:\ngit checkout -b &lt;branch_name&gt; main\nYou'll replace &lt;branch-name&gt; with something short and descriptive. For example, if you're adding a new\nitem to Fish Fight, your branch name might look like this:\ngit checkout -b add_new_weapon main\nCommit your changes\nOnce you've made the desired changes to the code and you're ready for someone on the Fish Fight\nteam to review, you need to commit your work. But first,\nwe have to run a few commands to ensure the code you're submitting is properly formatted:\n\ncargo clippy -- -W clippy::correctness -D warnings\ncargo fmt\n\nNow we can start committing your work. First, stage your changes:\ngit add\nNow commit. It's always good practice to provide a short message that details what the changes are. For example:\ngit commit -m \"Add a new weapon\"\nSubmitting for review\nYou can now start submitting your work for review. First, push your changes:\ngit push\nThis will create a new branch on your forked copy of Fish Fight.

Well, more precisely it's about giving feedback to confirm the player's actions. For games where flow and feeling matter, juice is the thing that makes the player understand your game without reading dials and processing numbers. Juice gives a game life and soul that makes the player feel like a part of the world. Juice is what makes a game feel fun without actually making any mechanical difference. And juice might just be what makes or breaks your game.\nWhenever you do something in real life you get a wide range of sensory input in return indicating that what you tried to do actually happened. That response grounds you and makes you realise the reality and weight of things. As you might guess, replicating that kind of feedback on a flatscreen is hard. To get anywhere near reality you need hyperreal effects and nerve-blasting feedback to fill in for all the missing senses, all the while walking the fine line of overloading your player and making a dry, unresponsive world.\nOf course, not all games need equal amounts of juice. Some games are played mostly in your head, and therefore all that visual feedback is not needed. Civilization has little more than flavour animations when a unit attacks, a town is built or a nuke blows up (actually the last one is pretty nice, but the real juice is your enemy’s tears). These are rather abstract both mechanically and visually, rarely pertaining to situations and perspectives we encounter in our everyday life. These games would still work with nothing but coloured circles and lines, because the strategy and the story exists in the player’s head. These games are planning games, where the payoff is to after thousands of years of careful strategising triumph over your enemy.\nOn the other side of the spectrum are execution games that test your reflexes and motor skills. These are played visually with the game continually telling the player what is going on. Here, the payoff is landing that single-frame-margin combo and watching your enemy explode into a glorious cloud of gibs. The juice that in a planning game exists in the player’s head must here be given by the game.\nFor realistic first-person games, juicing is difficult and labour-intensive in practice but easier in concept, as you can model the feedback off reality to align with the player’s expectations. But a side-scrolling shooter like Fish Fight is more difficult in theory. I’d doubt you have a clear picture of how stylised two-dimensional fish running and shooting each other would look in real life. For something so far detached from reality, you must work a lot in the same way as with symbol drawing: finding effects that represent their real-life counterparts without actually being them. You'll have to unhinge your expectations and think out of the box to find the feel you need.\nWorking with game feel\nThe worst part about working with game feel is that it is only ever noticed if it is bad. Good game feel is only felt, never seen. If the juice is so grandiose that the player starts thinking of it, it will wear them out and possibly even make them sick if too much stuff is moving onscreen. But if there is not enough of it, the game will feel dry and lifeless. The juice is there to constantly trigger and must therefore be just right. On that matter, juicing games is more artsy compared to, for instance, UI design. There are certain guidelines to follow, but mostly it's lots of tuning and testing. The easiest way to try the feel is simply to play the game! If even mundane actions like walking feels nice, you have really succeeded.\nJuicing also regards making the world feel alive by making it respond, cause and effect, to the player's actions. Whipping up dust while running or jostling foliage when walking through it are common effects that give the impression of a breathing coherent world in which all its separate parts coexist and interact. This doesn't do anything mechanically, but is equivalent to hitting a wooden crate and it not breaking. Now you maybe even shudder a bit at the thought of how lifeless, bland and plain wrong it would feel. Well, the player too has expectations on how the world should respond. Your task is to meet and feed into those expectations on all levels, from the core greyboxed mechanics to minute tweens and particle effects. Now, for some ways to actually squeeze some juice out of your games!\nScreen Shake\nScreen shake is an immensely powerful tool for giving heavy, visceral feedback that disorients the player as if their whole body was actually rumbling. When the entire scene shakes the player feels it, usually without thinking of it. Regular flatscreen games are only connected to two of the players senses, vision and hearing, and that is all you have to work with. The ears can be shaken about with some explosion noises, but to equally rustle the player’s eyes you need screen shake.\nScreen shake moves the player’s viewpoint around, translationally and/or rotationally, to make it appear the world is rumbling. Adding the right amount of shake is an art; it is crucial to not overdo screen shake as it can hamper readability and even make sensitive players motion sick, but at the same time it must be significant enough to be felt. People usually have very split opinions on screen shake. Some love the punch it gives, others detest the blurry jostling. Try to take a step back and don't get too caught up in the looks, the game must still be playable.\nScreen shake in practice in Fish Fight\nScreen shake is a lot about feel, and as such requires a lot of dialling in. In jumpy we will have three kinds of screen shake: noise (Perlin) translational, sinusoidal translational and rotational. Translational noise moves the world up- and sideways, while the rotational noise rotates the world around the screen midpoint. To that, you can also make the screen shake only in a certain axis to give it directionality. Omnidirectional shaking is the most common and can be used for pretty much everything. It fits explosions really well, but won't feel out of place for anything else either. The directional type on the other hand is more specialised and can for example be used vertically for jump impacts or horizontally for guns firing sideways. This further enhances feedback and narrows its meaning down, increasing clarity and readability.\nTo those types there’s three parameters: magnitude, frequency and length. Magnitude affects how far the screen moves when shaking (the amplitude of the oscillation) while frequency controls how ”many” shakes happen per second. The length decides for how long the shake will last for, and the magnitude decreases over this time to zero.\nBy mixing and matching different values for these parameters different effects can be made. Here are a few examples:\nGunshot: a short omnidirectional shake with low amplitude and high frequency. This gives a small kick that doesn’t move the screen too much, just enough to confirm the firing. Fish Fight supports setting multipliers for X/Y movement, so a 1 for X and a smaller number for Y makes the player feel the direction of the action.\nExplosion: a medium-length omnidirectional shake with decent amplitude and lower frequency. This makes a kind of rumble that seriously jostles the screen. The bigger the explosive the lower the frequency!\nJump impact: a directional sinusoidal shake makes the world bounce like a spring.\nTo calculate the final scene position, the current position of every active shake is added together. That value is then capped using a logarithmic function so that if many explosives go off at once, the scene does not fly off-screen. The second logarithm (log2x) is useful for this, as it is almost linear from 0-1 and then quickly flattens.\nParticles\nParticles like those in games rarely occur in real life, as most of us go through our daily routine avoiding high-impact situations. But games tend to be a bit more forceful and violent, and that of course means heaps of particles! Particles are a great way to create dynamic and exciting effects that further give impact and weight to actions, but also make the world seem more alive and responsive. Some examples are sparks flying when a bullet hits a wall or dust blowing around in a storm.\n","id":"/games/jumpy/game_design/juice/","title":"Juice and Feel"},"/games/jumpy/overview/":{"body":"","id":"/games/jumpy/overview/","title":"Overview"},"/games/jumpy/overview/introduction/":{"body":"\nOverview\nFish Folk: Jumpy is a tactical 2D shooter, played by up to 4 players online or on a shared screen.
